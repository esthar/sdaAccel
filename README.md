Amherst College Electronics Club: ATmega328 sample program for using I2C communication.
 
This sample program will read the x-axis reading from a 12-bit precision accelerometer and transmit it to the serial line. Using putty one can test the measurements.

If you haven't looked at the serGPS code yet, I recommend you do because I will not explain the serial communication part of this code. It is basically copied from there.
